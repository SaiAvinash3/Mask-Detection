# Mask-Detection

Due to COVID-19, our lives have changed completely, leading us to adapt to a new normal. Wearing masks has become mandatory when going out, but many people are not wearing them properly, putting others at risk. To address this issue, we leveraged machine learning to create a mask detection system. This system can be implemented in high-traffic areas like shopping malls, medical stores, temples, and more.

In the current scenario, efficient face mask detection applications are in high demand, particularly in densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers, and other enterprises to help curb the spread of COVID-19. 

Our project focuses on Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) from deep learning, specifically utilizing the MobileNetV2 architecture. We employed modules such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to develop this solution.
